## Markdown Test

It is very easy to make some words **bold** and other words *italic* using `MarkDown`

You can even link [Google](http://google.com)

I think you should use an
`<addr>` element here instead.

many of which make it easyer

```
def foo():
    if not bar:
        return True
```

- [x] 했고
- [ ] 안했고  
  - [x] 했고  
  - [x] 했고
  
  Any word wrapped with two tildes (like ~~this~~) will appear crossed out.
  
# ~~fuck~~
